## :rocket: Project Description

DroneHub is a mobile application developed in Kotlin that offers an online shopping experience for drone and unmanned aerial vehicle enthusiasts. Our application combines an attractive user interface (UI) design with a robust user experience (UX) to provide an immersive shopping experience. It uses Firebase, a non-relational database, to ensure efficient performance and reliable data management.

## :star2: Key Features

- **User Profile**: The top of the application displays the user's image and a welcome message, adding a personal touch to the user interface (UI) design.

- **Intuitive Navigation**: The app offers simple and clear navigation to explore categories and products, enhancing the user experience (UX).

- **Responsive Design**: The app's design adapts seamlessly to both landscape and portrait modes on mobile devices, ensuring an optimal user experience (UX).

- **Internationalization**: Support for English and Spanish, allowing users to switch the app's language for a better user experience (UX).

- **Filtering and Sorting**: Users can filter and sort the list of drones according to their preferences, enhancing the user experience.

- **Categories and Products**: Explore a wide range of categories and products with two attractive CardView designs.

- **Advanced Search**: Use the search field to quickly find the drones you desire.

## :gear: App Structure

DroneHub follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern to separate business logic from the user interface, simplifying development and improving the user experience (UX).

## :computer: Requirements

- Minimum Android Version: Android 5.0 (Lollipop)
- Maximum Android Version: Android 12
